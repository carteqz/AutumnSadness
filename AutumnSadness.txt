Standing at the edge
High up on the stairs.
I feel it in the air
Summer time sadness
Talking to myself
I´m glad no one is there
When I react to the world
World down was never fair.

Standing at the edge
High Up on the stairs.
I feel it in the air
It’s the autumn/fall time sadness
Talking to myself 
I’m glad no one is there 
When I try to fill the void,
The voices never rest. 

Before to start all over
I face my myself.
It might have been the
Last.. Last farewell.
I just want you to know
you´re the best.
Baby, I´ll love you til
my last breath.

Before to start all over
I face my myself.
It might have been the
Last.. Last farewell.
I just want you to know
you´re the best.
Baby, i´ll love you til
my last breath.

Before to start all over
I face my myself.
Is Anyone listening to my prayers?
It might have been the
Last.. Last farewell.
Baby I was bornready 
To face the death.

Ooooh 4x
