I´m on the edge
High up the stairs.

I feel it in the air
Fall/Autumn time sadness

I´m glad no one is there
When i react to a world
World down was never fair.

Talking to myself 
I’m glad no one is there
emotion react to a world.
was never fair.

I’m on the edge
High Up the stairs.
I feel it in the air
It’s the autumn/fall time sadness

Taking to myself 
I’m glad no one is there (just)
want you to know
Baby you’re the best.

Try to fill the void,
The voices never rest.
I’m not even scared.

Baby I was born ready 
to face the death.

OOOOooooOOOOoooo

























About to face the death
I’m not even scared.
 (Who’s gonna save me
Save me now)
Can’t stop the tears 
tears from falling down)


Sizzling like a snare
Electric wire catch on fire
Deep in my soul i can feel
I feel Everywhere.


Taking away my breath
And Even if I go 
The world was never fair.
Who cares?
Fresh air

On top of the roof
The air cold & calm
You don't want to hear it right now



Of me and you
The world is down there
Out of view
Please don't jump


You open your eyes
But you can't remember what for
The snow falls quietly
You just can't feel it no more

Somewhere up there
You lost yourself in your pain
You dream of the end
To start all over again
I don't know how long
I can hold you so strong
I don't know how long

Just take my hand
I'll gave you the chance
