Ion the edge
High up the stairs.

High top of the stairs
10k feet, ten k stairs.
Walk up the stairs.

I feel in the air
It’s summertime sadness

Talking to myself 
Love is no longer there
I’m glad no one is there to see( I just)
Im glad no one cares about to

One’s emotion reactions
to a world that was never fair.


I’m on the edge
High Up the stairs.

I can feel it in the air
It’s summer time sadness

Taking to myself 
I’m glad no one is there (just)

want you to know
Baby you’re the best.

Try to fill the void 
The voices never rest.

(Helpless individual who was never found)
(Who’s gonna save me
Save me now)
Helpless individual who was never 
found)
Can’t stop the tears 
tears from falling down)



Sizzling like a snare
Electric wire catch on fire
Deep in my soul i can feel
I feel Everywhere.

About to face the death
I’m not even scared.

Baby I’m not scared
Of death.

Baby I’m not scared
I was born ready 
to face the death.

Taking away my breath
And Even if I go 
The world was never fair.
Who cares?
Fresh air

On top of the roof
The air cold & calm
I say your name in silence
You don't want to hear it right now

The eyes of the city
Are counting the tears falling down
Each one a promise of everything
You never found

I scream into the night for you
Don't make it true
Don't jump
The lights will not guide you through
They're deceiving you
Don't jump
Don't let memories go
Of me and you
The world is down there
Out of view
Please don't jump


ADVERTISING


You open your eyes
But you can't remember what for
The snow falls quietly
You just can't feel it no more

Somewhere up there
You lost yourself in your pain
You dream of the end
To start all over again
I don't know how long
I can hold you so strong
I don't know how long

Just take my hand
I'll gave you the chance
Don't jump

I scream into the night for you
Don't make it true
Don't jump
The lights will not guide you through
They're deceiving you
Don't jump
Don't let memories go
Of me and you
The world is down there
Out of view
Please don't jump
Don't jump

And if all that can't hold you back
I'll jump for you
